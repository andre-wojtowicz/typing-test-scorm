# Interactive typing test

This repository contains scripts to wrap <https://github.com/yaswanthteja/Typing-speed-test> into SCORM 1.2 package. I use it to grade students' activity in Moodle.

Settings to be graded max points (120 seconds):

* mistakes <= 3,
* WPM >= 90,
* CPM >= 200.

The latest automatically built SCORM package can be downloaded from [Releases](https://github.com/andre-wojtowicz/typing-test-scorm).

[Live demo](https://andre-wojtowicz.github.io/typing-test-scorm/) with simple SCO run-time test environment (click "Launch SCO" in top-left corner).

### Adjusting maximum grade

SCORM `cmi.core.score.max` value is set to `1`, so by default (as described in the section
above) *Maximum grade* should be set to `1`. If you want to give e.g. `6` points for this activity,
then change settings in:

1. the SCORM activity: `Grade > Maximum grade` to `6`;
2. Gradebook setup page the grade item related to the SCORM activity: `Grade item > Multiplicator` to `6`.
